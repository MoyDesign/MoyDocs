## Browser plugin

Websites data is never sent anywhere. **Parsing and templating are done on the client (in your browser).** This means you can use Moy even for websites with sensitive data. This also means you need to install a browser plugin.

> <small>The *Try it!* page doesn't require plugin, but it's very limited and supposed to be used for demo only. It only has access to public data.</small>

The plugin's available for Chrome and Firefox (including Firefox for Android).

* [Install for Chrome](/extension/chrome)
* [Install for Firefox](/extension/firefox)

Then, click on the plugin icon in your toolbar and click ~~Sign in~~. After that, your plugin is linked to your Moy account and ready for work!

If everything's OK, you should see this next time you click the plugin's icon:

> <small> Accessing Moy can take some time.</small>

~~Update~~ makes the plugin to sync with the server. Normally, the plugin does it automatically.

Depending on the current state, other controls appear there:

1. ~~Disable plugin for this tab~~ turns off the plugin for the current tab.
2. ~~Enable plugin for this tab~~ turns on the plugin for the current tab.
3. ~~Share look~~ opens this page in a new tab with URL, which doesn't require the plugin. You can make sure everything look OK and share this URL. Even people without the plugin or Moy account will see it as you do.
4. **Try new looks** suggests new looks for this page. Click on them to check out. If you like one, click ~~Keep this look~~ to save it for you. If not, just refresh the page.
