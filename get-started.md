## Get started

We prepared a test page: [this one](/example/lorem-ipsum.html). It is not quite the example of good design. Now, in three simple and quick steps, we'll make it look far better without changing the page itself.

1. In [Parsers](/parser), find the [Moy example](/parser?q=Moy+example) parser.
2. Click ~~Pick a template~~ under it and find the **Safari-like reader** template.
3. Click <u>Try it!</u> and the following into the web address field: `https://moy.design/example/lorem-ipsum.html`, click ~~Submit~~

Hopefully, you agree this looks better. If you want to see the page like this each time you visit it, you need to do two more steps (which, unlike the others, require [login](/login)):

4. Click ~~Bind~~ (the button near <u>Try it!</u>), fill in the name field and submit.
5. Install browser [plugin](#plugin).

## What happened?

You found a [parser](/doc#parser) suitable for our test page. Parsers extract valuable information from web pages. Parsers are made by users. You can (and encouraged to) [make](/parser/new) your own, if there is no parser yet for some web site, or you don't like the existing ones.

Then, you found a suitable [template](/doc#template). Templates show the information extracted by parsers. They're not tightly bound to parsers, but rather represent the collection of new looks to choose from. Different parsers may be used with the same template, and vice versa.

You tried the new look and was satisfied with it (hopefully). So, you created a [binding](/doc#binding). Bindings are the way to save your preferences. Next time you visit the site, you'll see it the way **you** like. 

To make bindings work, you need browser plugin.
